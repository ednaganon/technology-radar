While we still like it as a tool, we are moving it out from trial back to assess since Grunt has both a broader usage model and better industry adoption and tooling. We do see some teams successfully using Gulp inside Grunt, when the speed of intermediate result caching is required, but we are not recommending it as the default JavaScript build tool.",
